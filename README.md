# Contagxt

Welcome to **Contagxt**!

## 🚧 Project Status: Intentionally Empty

This repository is currently **intentionally left empty**. Contagxt is in an early development phase, and while we are committed to open-sourcing the project in the future, we have not yet released any code.

## 📬 Why This Repository Exists

Although there's no code here yet, this repository serves an important purpose: **to connect with you**. We’re using this space to:

- Gather early feedback  
- Understand community needs  
- Build a foundation for collaborative development  

## 🔮 Open Source Plans

We absolutely plan to open-source Contagxt! However, due to current development priorities and strategic considerations, the full release will happen **at the right time**—when the codebase is stable, well-documented, and ready for community contribution.

Until then, your input is invaluable.

## 💬 How to Get Involved

Even without code, you can help shape Contagxt’s future:

- **Open an issue** to share ideas, feature requests, or concerns  
- **Star this repo** to show interest and stay updated  
- **Watch the repository** to get notified when we make our first public commit  

We read every message and appreciate your patience and enthusiasm.

Thank you for being part of Contagxt’s journey—from day zero.
